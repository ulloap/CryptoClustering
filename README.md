# CryptoClustering
Module19

## Analysis:
By using unsupervised learning, cryptocurrency changes were predicted for a 24-hour and 7-day price. Elbow curves and clustering graphs were created, first by using the original data, and second by reducing the amount of data down to 3.

The elbow curve for both measures remained at k=4, however, the inertia value for the PCA elbow curve was much lower. 

The clusters for the PCA graph were better defined, making it easier for the user to find more distinct patterns.
